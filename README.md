travel cost saver. Compare multiple travel options, Including driving, to determine the best cost/time ratio

We choose to use the MEAN stack. Javascript is fast and non-blocking. Also it is advantageous to have both the front-end and back-end in

To use this application make sure you have mongodb, node, and npm already isntalled. Start up mongodb with mongod.exe. Then use npm install on the root directory to install all the dependencies listed in package.json.
